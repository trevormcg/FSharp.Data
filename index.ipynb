"================================\n",
"\n",
"The FSharp.Data package implements core functionality to \n",
"access common data formats in your F# applications and scripts. It contains F# type \n",
"providers for working with structured file formats (CSV, HTML, JSON and XML) and helpers for parsing \n",
"CSV, HTML and JSON files and for sending HTTP requests.\n",
"\n",
"This library focuses on providing simple access to the structured documents \n",
"and other data sources. \n",
"\n",
"FSharp.Data stems from [Types from data Making structured data first-class citizens in F#](http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/fsharp-data/) by Petricek, Syme and Guerra. This paper\n",
"received a Distinguished Paper award at PLDI 2016 and was selected as one of three CACM Research\n",
"Highlight in 2018. 🏆🏆🏆\n",

"The FSharp.Data type providers for CSV, HTML, JSON and XML infer types from the structure of a sample \n",
"document (or a document containing multiple samples). The structure is then used\n",
"to provide easy to use type-safe access to documents that follow the same structure.\n",
"\n",
" * [CSV Type Provider](library/CsvProvider.html) - discusses the `CsvProvider\u003c..\u003e` type\n",
" * [HTML Type Provider](library/HtmlProvider.html) - discusses the `HtmlProvider\u003c...\u003e` type\n",

"## Data Access Tools\n",
" \n",
"The package contains functionality to simplify data access. In particular, it includes tools for HTTP web requests and \n",
"CSV, HTML, and JSON parsers with simple dynamic API. For more information, see the \n",
"following topics:\n",
"\n",
" * [HTTP Utilities](library/Http.html) - discusses the `Http` type that can be used\n",

"## Tutorials\n",
"\n",
"The following tutorials contain additional examples that \n",

" * [Converting between JSON and XML](tutorials/JsonToXml.html) - implements two serialization \n",
"   functions that convert between the standard .NET `XElement` and the `JsonValue` from FSharp.Data.\n",
"   The tutorial demonstrates pattern matching on `JsonValue`.\n",
" * [Anonymizing JSON](tutorials/JsonAnonymizer.html) - implements a function to anonymize a `JsonValue` from FSharp.Data.\n",
